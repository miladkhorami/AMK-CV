Originally from Baghlan Andarab, I currently resides in Khair Khana, Kabul Learn education at Iqra Afghanistan high school Creativity on Computer in the department of Web development and also Public Figure In Social Media Work on MAK Media. I have skills in various areas, but my main expertise lies in programming, and I’ve gained moderate recognition in this field. I am proficient in both frontend and backend development, working on website and application development. I’m a full-stack developer, which means I am capable of designing attractive user interfaces as well as managing databases and server-side logic.

    I am fluent in both English and French, which allows me to work with international resources easily. In terms of UI design, I work with tools and frameworks like Figma, Adobe XD, Tailwind CSS, and Material UI. I specialize in creating custom and specific styles for UI designs, adapting them to the needs of each project.
    
    Now it’s in first-person. Let me know if anything else needs changing.</p>
